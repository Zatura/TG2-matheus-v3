    abstract = {Data-driven methods for physical simulation are an attractive option for interactive applications due to their ability to trade precomputation and memory footprint in exchange for improved runtime performance. Yet, existing data-driven methods fall short of the extreme memory and performance constraints imposed by modern interactive applications like AAA games and virtual reality. Here, performance budgets for physics simulation range from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds per frame, per object. We present a data-driven physical simulation method that meets these constraints. Our method combines subspace simulation techniques with machine learning which, when coupled, enables a very efficient subspace-only physics simulation that supports interactions with external objects - a longstanding challenge for existing subspace techniques. We also present an interpretation of our method as a special case of subspace Verlet integration, where we apply machine learning to efficiently approximate the physical forces of the system directly in the subspace. We propose several practical solutions required to make effective use of such a model, including a novel training methodology required for prediction stability, and a GPU-friendly subspace decompression algorithm to accelerate rendering.},

    abstract = {In the context of news recommendations, many time-aware approaches were proposed. These approaches have tried to capture the recency of news with respect to their short life span, by using either decaying weights on past articles or even forgetting them. However, most of these approaches have missed to consider sessions, which encapsulate inside them the articles that a user has interacted with in a short time period. In this paper, we provide news recommendations based on user sessions to reveal their short-term intentions. We also combine content-based with collaborative filtering to deal with the severe data sparsity problem that exists in our real-life data set. We have experimentally seen that the users' interests evolve over time and that our strategies can adapt fast to these changes.},

    abstract = {Session identification is a common strategy used to develop metrics for web analytics and perform behavioral analyses of user-facing systems. Past work has argued that session identification strategies based on an inactivity threshold is inherently arbitrary or has advocated that thresholds be set at about 30 minutes. In this work, we demonstrate a strong regularity in the temporal rhythms of user initiated events across several different domains of online activity (incl. video gaming, search, page views and volunteer contributions). We describe a methodology for identifying clusters of user activity and argue that the regularity with which these activity clusters appear implies a good rule-of-thumb inactivity threshold of about 1 hour. We conclude with implications that these temporal rhythms may have for system design based on our observations and theories of goal-directed human activity.},

    abstract = "Web Navigation Prediction is a popular area of research as users on the web are continuously growing. Capturing users’ behavior provides insights about the user demands, accessibility patterns, and inconsistencies in the website design. Several navigation models have been developed in the past. Most of the models rely upon fixed threshold mechanism for prediction, which is inadequate as they require multiple computational steps which not necessarily give the best possible value. To combat this issue, we propose two models based on dynamic thresholds: All-Kth Modified Markov Model based on Geometric threshold (KMMMG) and (b) All-Kth Modified Markov Model based on Branching Factor Threshold (KMMMBF). Our experiments show that longer navigations are rare and are highly co-related. However, smaller navigations are more and are less co-related. Dynamic threshold models produce more optimum predictions as compare to fixed threshold models. KMMMBF performs the best and achieves the highest prediction accuracy, 78.53%, 91.32%, and 61.37% on CTI, MSWEB, and BMS dataset, respectively."

We address the problem of product size recommendations based on customer purchase and return data. We propose a novel approach based on Bayesian logit and probit regression models with ordinal categories Small, Fit, Largeto model size fits as a function of the difference between latent sizes of customers and products. We propose posterior computation based on mean-field variational inference, leveraging the Polya-Gamma augmentation for the logit prior, that results in simple updates, enabling our technique to efficiently handle large datasets. Our Bayesian approach effectively deals with issues arising from noise and sparsity in the data providing robust recommendations. Offline experiments with real-life shoe datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in 5 of 6 datasets. and leads to an improvement of 17-26% in AUC over baselines when predicting size fit outcomes.},
